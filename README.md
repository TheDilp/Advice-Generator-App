## My process

- My process consisted of writing out HTML and CSS first, getting a rough idea for a layout, starting with the mobile design. Then I used Javascript to add functionality to the site - getting data from an API with the fetch API, both on page load as well as when the user clicks on the button.
- Then I worked on the desktop design.
- Finally I focused on getting the design as close as possible to the provided files.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Plain Javascript

### What I learned

- How to use media queries in Javascript (via window.matchMedia)
- That using "textContent" is a [better idea]("https://kellegous.com/j/2013/02/27/innertext-vs-textcontent/") than using "innerText" 

### Continued development

The project only requires 2 media queries (375px and 1440px), continued development would include adding more device sizes to achieve better responsiveness.

### Useful resources

- [innerText vs textContent]("https://kellegous.com/j/2013/02/27/innertext-vs-textcontent/") - This helped me understand the differences between innerText and textContent.
